# Restaurant Review Sentiment Analysis

This repository contains Python code and a dataset for performing sentiment analysis on restaurant reviews. The goal is to classify reviews as positive or negative, providing valuable insights for restaurant owners and potential customers.
The requirement was to predict the Restaurant review with training and testing accuracy to be nearly equal.
First model:Using GuassianNB. The data loading and preprocessing steps are done and GuassianNB algorithm is used.Using this algorithm the accuracy was 74%.
Second model:Using Random forest classifier. Using this algorithm the training accuracy is 79.62% and the testing accuracy is 78% and this satisfies the requirement that training and testing accuracy should be similar. Using random forest classifier we can achieve greater accuracies.
Finally our model predicted the positive(output=1) review and negative(output=0) review correctly.
